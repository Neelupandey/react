    <p>Nature is all the naturally occurring things on this planet. Nature is the animals, plants, events, processes,
        and products of the earth that are not made by people. It is the physical world and everything that lives in it.

        “Nature” is more than just a word for plants, animals, and habitats. She is a complex living organism that
        produces and nurtures life. That’s why we call her “Mother Nature.” We may view ourselves as separate from
        Nature,
        especially when we use words like “man-made” to describe something that is NOT natural. But this notion is far
        from the truth.</p>
